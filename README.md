# Hangman

A Hangman game based on the 50 US states, 5 inhabited territories, and Washington, D.C. 

Features:
- Region maps that change for each word!
- Wikipedia links for each word!
- A clip of a John Philip Sousa classic!

I used vanilla JS and Bootstrap and learned that Bootstrap is great if you're really more focused on the JS code and just need a basic template ;P That said, it does look clean and neat, no?

When you have 56 hangman words, it's unreasonable to have 56 images (unless I hosted them elsewhere), so I went with US census regions and other logical groupings.
